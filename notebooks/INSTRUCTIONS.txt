VLA Presentation - Execution Instructions
==========================================

You have 2 Colab notebooks ready. Here's the order of operations:

STEP 1: Upload & Run Training Notebook (~10-12 hours total)
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload "01_vla_training.ipynb"
3. Runtime > Change runtime type > A100 GPU, High-RAM
4. Run all cells in order
5. Cell 1 will restart the runtime -- that's expected, just continue from Cell 2
6. The fine-tuning run takes ~5 hours, the from-scratch run takes another ~5 hours
7. You can run them overnight -- just make sure Colab doesn't disconnect
   TIP: Keep the tab active, or use a Colab keep-alive browser extension
8. After training, the final cell uploads checkpoints to HuggingFace Hub

STEP 2: Upload & Run Introspection Notebook (~1-2 hours)
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Upload "02_vla_introspection.ipynb" to Colab (same A100 runtime)
2. Update FINETUNED_PATH at the top to point to your checkpoint
   (either the local path from Step 1, or your HF Hub repo ID)
3. Run all cells -- each section generates presentation-ready PNG figures
4. The final cell zips all figures and downloads them to your machine

STEP 3: Collect Videos
-----------------------
The training notebook's eval cells produce evaluation episodes.
For side-by-side videos, you may need to:
- Record the env.render() output during eval episodes
- Use ffmpeg to stitch frames into video:
  ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
- Or use matplotlib.animation to save directly from the notebook

WHAT YOU'LL HAVE AFTER:
- Training loss curves (from W&B dashboard)
- Success rate comparison chart (3-way: scratch vs zero-shot vs fine-tuned)
- Attention heatmaps (per task phase, pretrained vs fine-tuned)
- Action distribution plots (10 noise seeds)
- Language conditioning probe (similarity matrix + trajectory divergence)
- Failure analysis (gripper trajectories, reward curves, frame comparisons)
- t-SNE embeddings (before vs after fine-tuning)
- All saved as high-resolution PNGs ready for slides
